# Computer Architecture and Design
This repository collects all the programs developed during the university course *Computer Architecture and Design*. The repository is structured into two main parts:

- **Motorola 68k**: This section contains all the programs developed in the first part of the course, written in assembly language (specifically for the Motorola 68k processor).
- **C Programming**: This section includes all the programs developed for the NUCLEO Board using CubeIDE.

Each part is further divided into two subfolders:

- **Homework**: Exercises assigned by the professor for practice.
- **Exercises**: Exercises developed independently to prepare for the exam.
